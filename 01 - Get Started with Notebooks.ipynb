    "Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based service for creating and managing machine learning solutions. It's designed to help data scientists and machine learning engineers leverage their existing data processing and model development skills and frameworks, and scale their workloads to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of data science and machine learning work is accomplished in notebooks like this one. Notebooks consist of *cells*, some of which (like the one containing this text) are used for notes, graphics, and other content  usually written using *markdown*; while others (like the cell below this one) contain code that you can run interactively within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Azure Machine Learning Python SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run pretty much any Python code in a notebook, provided the required Python packages are installed in the environment where you're running it. In this case, you're running the notebook in a *Conda* environment on an Azure Machine Learning compute instance. This environment is installed in the compute instance by default, and contains common Python packages that data scientists typically work with. It also includes the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, which is a Python package that enables you to write code that uses resources in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.\n",

    "Run the cell below to import the **azureml-core** package and checking the version of the SDK that is installed."

    "All experiments and associated resources are managed within your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can connect to an existing workspace, or create a new one using the Azure Machine Learning SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, you should store workspace connection information in a JSON configuration file. This makes it easier to connect without needing to remember details like your Azure subscription ID. You can download the JSON configuration file from the blade for your workspace in the Azure portal or from the workspace details pane in Azure Machine Learning studio, but if you're using a compute instance within your wokspace, the configuration file has already been downloaded to the root folder.\n",

After you have successfully signed in, you can close the browser tab that was opened and return to this notebook."
